            Hyperloop is Elon Muskâ€™s concept for the future of mass
            transportation. It offers a new means of transporting people and
            goods quickly, safely, efficiently, and with minimised environmental
            impact.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Hyperloop uses electric propulsion to accelerate a passenger or
            cargo pod through a low-pressure tube. The autonomous pod employs
            magnetic levitation to eliminate friction. The Hyperloop would allow
            travel times considerably shorter than current rail or air travel
            times. Carbon emissions, noise, delays, journey time, weather
            concerns and pilot error are ultimately eliminated.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2017, I joined HYPED, a team of over 100+ students across
            academic disciplines at the University of Edinburgh dedicated to
            accelerating the development of Hyperloop. HYPED is advancing both
            technical and commercial development of Hyperloop, having seen
            success in two international competitions.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the SpaceX Competition 2018, we spent a year designing and
            engineering our very own Hyperloop Pod. Our pod made use of passive
            magnetic levitation, Halbach wheel propulsion and highly
            sophisticated software for navigation and control systems.
            <br />
            After months of hard work, we got selected for the finals of the
            SpaceX Competition in Hawthorne, California.
            <br />
            The final week was an extremely challenging but exciting experience.
            Engineers from SpaceX walked us through a variety of hard technical
            tests and challenges that were able to manage very successfully. Due
            to a malfunction of our CAN-BUS tranceiver at the very end, we were
            not able to make it to the last run but we were very happy to have
            reached the 6th place among hundreds of universities.
