              I studied Artifical Intelligence and Computer Science at the
              University of Edinburgh and wrote my thesis on computational drug
              discovery.

              I am interested in how Information Theory connects the seemingly
              unrelated fields of Machine Learning, Bayesian Inference,
              Thermodynamics, Systems Biology and Reinforcement Learning.{" "}

              I am passionate about Synthetic Biology and how we can program
              Biology to better understand complex biological systems and solve
              important problems in medicine and the environment.
