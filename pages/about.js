          I’m intrigued by languages, philosophy, science and design and
          passionate about the development of global policies and federalism to
          tackle our world’s issues such as poverty and climate change.

          I love to travel, play the guitar and do all kinds of sports and I am
          constantly seeking to be inspired, to solve the truly important
          problems and to be surrounded by people I love.
